### Description

Describe what work this pull request includes. There's no need to list line-by-line (the change list will do that);
instead just summarise each bit of functionality that's been added, edited or removed. Good code should be
self-documenting (aka, show _what_ it's achieving) so focus on the explaining why you took the approach you did.

There's no need to write an essay - we welcome bullet points over prose.
